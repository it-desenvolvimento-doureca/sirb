FileSaver.js
============

<<<<<<< HEAD
FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is perfect for
web apps that generates files on the client, However if the file is coming from the
server we recommend you to first try to use [Content-Disposition][8] attachment response header as it has more cross-browser compatiblity.
=======
FileSaver.js implements the `saveAs()` FileSaver interface in browsers that do
not natively support it. There is a [FileSaver.js demo][1] that demonstrates saving
various media types.

FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is perfect for
webapps that need to generate files, or for saving sensitive information that shouldn't be
sent to an external server.

Looking for `canvas.toBlob()` for saving canvases? Check out
[canvas-toBlob.js][2] for a cross-browser implementation.

Feature detection is possible:

```js
try {
    var isFileSaverSupported = !!new Blob;
} catch (e) {}
```

### IE < 10

It is possible to save text files in IE < 10 without Flash-based polyfills.
See [ChenWenBrian and koffsyrup's `saveTextAs()`](https://github.com/koffsyrup/FileSaver.js#examples) for more details.

### Safari 6.1+

Blobs may be opened instead of saved sometimes—you may have to direct your Safari users to manually
press <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save the file after it is opened. Using the `application/octet-stream` MIME type to force downloads [can cause issues in Safari](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/issues/12#issuecomment-47247096).

### iOS

<<<<<<< HEAD
saveAs must be run within a user interaction event such as onTouchDown or onClick; setTimeout will prevent saveAs from triggering. Due to restrictions in iOS saveAs opens in a new window instead of downloading, if you want this fixed please [tell Apple how this WebKit bug is affecting you](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=167341).

Syntax
------
### Import `saveAs()` from file-saver
```js
import { saveAs } from 'file-saver';
```

```js
FileSaver saveAs(Blob/File/Url, optional DOMString filename, optional Object { autoBom })
```

Pass `{ autoBom: true }` if you want FileSaver.js to automatically provide Unicode text encoding hints (see: [byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)). Note that this is only done if your blob type has `charset=utf-8` set.

Examples
--------

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Saving text using `require()`
```js
var FileSaver = require('file-saver');
var blob = new Blob(["Hello, world!"], {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
FileSaver.saveAs(blob, "hello world.txt");
```

=======
>>>>>>> aa167a7d63b9fa01b26efb1fceaeb7aed3e4b2ea
### Saving text

```js
var blob = new Blob(["Hello, world!"], {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
<<<<<<< HEAD
FileSaver.saveAs(blob, "hello world.txt");
```

### Saving URLs

```js
FileSaver.saveAs("https://httpbin.org/image", "image.jpg");
```
Using URLs within the same origin will just use `a[download]`.
Otherwise, it will first check if it supports cors header with a synchronous head request.
If it does, it will download the data and save using blob URLs. 
If not, it will try to download it using `a[download]`.
=======
saveAs(blob, "hello world.txt");
```
>>>>>>> aa167a7d63b9fa01b26efb1fceaeb7aed3e4b2ea

The standard W3C File API [`Blob`][4] interface is not available in all browsers.
[Blob.js][5] is a cross-browser `Blob` implementation that solves this.

### Saving a canvas
<<<<<<< HEAD
```js
var canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas");
=======

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById("my-canvas"), ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
// draw to canvas...
>>>>>>> aa167a7d63b9fa01b26efb1fceaeb7aed3e4b2ea
canvas.toBlob(function(blob) {
    saveAs(blob, "pretty image.png");
});
```

Note: The standard HTML5 `canvas.toBlob()` method is not available in all browsers.
[canvas-toBlob.js][6] is a cross-browser `canvas.toBlob()` that polyfills this.

### Saving File

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can save a File constructor without specifying a filename. If the
file itself already contains a name, there is a hand full of ways to get a file
instance (from storage, file input, new constructor, clipboard event). 
If you still want to change the name, then you can change it in the 2nd argument.

```js
// Note: Ie and Edge don't support the new File constructor,
// so it's better to construct blobs and use saveAs(blob, filename)
var file = new File(["Hello, world!"], "hello world.txt", {type: "text/plain;charset=utf-8"});
FileSaver.saveAs(file);
